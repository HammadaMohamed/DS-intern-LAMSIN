** Engineering intenrship project **

The goal of this project is to anlyse and predict weather behavior using ML/DL models.

** About the data **

This dataset contains synthetic weather data generated for ten major American cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, and San Jos√©. Each city is associated with a wide range of climatic parameters, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, providing an overview of local atmospheric variations. In total, one million data points have been generated for each parameter, allowing for thorough and robust analysis of weather conditions in these different locations, facilitating modeling and prediction studies.
